# My Trip to Sreemangal and Sylhet

In late October 2024, I embarked on a memorable journey to **Sreemangal** and **Sylhet** with my wife. We planned a five-day trip, filled with scenic beauty and adventure. The trip was scheduled from **October 24 to October 28**.

### Day 1: Arrival in Sylhet

We began our journey by taking a **train to Sylhet**. After arriving on the 24th, we headed straight to **Rahamas B&B**, our accommodation for the stay. We reached the hotel well before **1 PM** and settled in. 

### Day 2-3: Exploring Sreemangal

On the second day, we traveled to **Sreemangal**, known as the "Tea Capital of Bangladesh." The lush green tea gardens, serene landscapes, and the famous **Lawachara National Park** made the trip unforgettable. We spent our time trekking through the forests and enjoying the calm beauty of nature.

### Day 4: Discovering Sylhet

Back in Sylhet, we visited some local landmarks and cultural sites, including the beautiful **Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST)**. We also took time to relax and enjoy some delicious Sylheti food.

### Day 5: Departure

On the final day, we packed our bags and prepared for our **morning flight** back home. The trip ended on the 28th, and we were ready to return, but not without fond memories of our time in the picturesque regions of Sylhet and Sreemangal.
